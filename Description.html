  <p>In this project, our primary aim is to develop an accurate car price prediction model using machine learning techniques. We're focusing on building a sophisticated system that leverages the capabilities of predictive analytics to unravel valuable insights for new companies in the automotive industry, particularly tailored for a used car seller company and also to empower individual car owners looking to sell their vehicles. The goal is to assist these companies in making informed decisions about their pricing strategies.</p>

  <p>The dataset consists of 11,914 entries representing various car features. The columns include information such as the make, model, year, engine fuel type, engine horsepower, engine cylinders, transmission type, driven wheels, number of doors, market category, vehicle size, vehicle style, highway miles per gallon (MPG), city MPG, popularity, and Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP).</p>

  <h3>Usages</h3>
  <p>-	This project was programmed in Python language (ver. 3.11.5).</p>
  <p>-	Some of the libraries used in this project include Scikit-learn, pickle, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.</p>
  <p>-	Web-Application created using Streamlit.</p>

  <h3>How to use it?</h3>
  <p>-  Go to the Predictor tab of the website and update required car details.</p>
  <p>-  Click on the Predict Price button which appears below the form. The application shall then analyse and show its prediction.</p>
  <p>-  Also provided are additional tabs Info and Contact Here, you can go through the source dataset the developers used to build the Price Predictor.</p>
  <p>-  You can click on the Contact Us tab wherein you may leave your valuable feedback or report issues with the page to the developers and administrators via email.</p>

  <h3>Machine Learning Models used in the project:</h3>
  <p>-  Linear Regression</p>
  <p>-  Decision Tree Regressor</p>
  <p>-  Random Forest Regressor</p>
  <p>-  K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor</p>
  <p>-  Gradient Boosting Regressor</p>
  <p>-  XGBoost Regressor Regressor</p>

  <p>Conclusion </p>
  <p>After a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, distinct variations in mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) have been observed across different algorithms. Notably, the Gradient Boosting algorithm emerges as a standout performer, showcasing superior predictive accuracy. The achievement of a remarkable 99% R-squared score underscores the model's excellent fit to the data.</p>
